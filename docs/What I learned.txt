It's a very difficult question to ask as I feel that I did not know anything when the course begun and now I feel much more confident with developing.
I understood the importance of knowing how to work alone. I supposed to do the project with a friend who decided to postpone the course so I found myself alone. I was very afraid not to succeed in the course so I started to see all the lectures from the beginning combining it with lectured from YouTube.
It was very difficult because there was not enough time for all the parts of the project as the course was very short and it was very difficult to combine it with full time job.
I am very proud of my project, I did not believe in the beginning that I will actually have something that works. I have learned the importance of design patterns and the use of algorithms in development and all these tolls helped me a lot. I am a little bit frustrated of myself because I tried to the client server part and just did not managed to do it and it is a pity because I saw all the lectures. I hope that I will know how to do it once.
I enjoyed doing the project, It was very difficult and it even made me cry sometimes but it's like a baby :)
